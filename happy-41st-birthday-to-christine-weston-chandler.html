        <h3><center>41 years ago Christopher Weston Chandler was born to his parents Bob</center></h3>
        <h3><center>and Barb. Since then, he has undergone two name changes and one</center></h3>
        <h3><center>gender change. Now, she goes by Christine Weston Chandler and is</center></h3>
        <h3><center>currently residing in Central Virginia Regional Jail.</center></h3>
        <br>
        <h3><center>Over the past 20 years Chris has cemented himself as a staple of the</center></h3>
        <h3><center>internet and become one of, if not the most well-documented humans</center></h3>
        <h3><center>ever to have lived. As a child he was diagnosed with autism and went</center></h3>
        <h3><center>through a yearslong period of muteness. Throughout high school he</center></h3>
        <h3><center>was only friends with girls, all of whom his parents had an</center></h3>
        <h3><center>arrangement with. In college he began pursuing a ‘love quest,’ in</center></h3>
        <h3><center>which he held a sign in public and attempted to court female fellow</center></h3>
        <h3><center>students. He was later expelled. He gradually began increasing his</center></h3>
        <h3><center>internet presence by publishing his homemade original character</center></h3>
        <h3><center>Sonichu's comic series. This attracted the attention of many online</center></h3>
        <h3><center>trolls who would harass him throughout his life. In 2016, Chris</center></h3>
        <h3><center>transitioned and became a real woman. Since then Chris's mental</center></h3>
        <h3><center>health has been on a downward spiral due to nasty trolls. In 2021</center></h3>
        <h3><center>Chris admitted to having sex with his mother and was arrested. He</center></h3>
        <h3><center>has been held in prison ever since.</center></h3>
        <br>
        <h3><center>Some might say Chris's story is sick or twisted. And it is. But I believe</center></h3>
        <h3><center>that it is still an inspirational tale. We, just like Chris, should strive for</center></h3>
        <h3><center>our dreams no matter what, even if the whole world is against us.</center></h3>
        <h3><center>Never stop trying. Never back down and ride the tiger.</center></h3>
